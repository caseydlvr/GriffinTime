An Android app for keeping track of Griffin Time. Griffin Time is a new method of telling time developed by Griffin McElroy. It is detailed in the intro segment of the podcast [My Brother My Brother And Me episode 379](http://www.maximumfun.org/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/mbmbam-379-6969-cool-street).

The app is designed to be exist and function solely as a notification (though there is also an app screen for your enjoyment). Simply launch the app once to turn on the notification, then use the notification's "YES" action (available in the notification's expanded view) to advance the time whenever the criteria for the next time has been met. The notification can be disabled or made dismissible via the app's setting page (accessible via the gear icon on the top right of the app screen).
